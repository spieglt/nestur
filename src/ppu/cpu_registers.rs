        The PPUDATA read buffer (post-fetch)
        When reading while the VRAM address is in the range 0-$3EFF (i.e., before the palettes),
        the read will return the contents of an internal read buffer. This internal buffer is
        updated only when reading PPUDATA, and so is preserved across frames. After the CPU reads
        and gets the contents of the internal buffer, the PPU will immediately update the internal
        buffer with the byte at the current VRAM address. Thus, after setting the VRAM address,
        one should first read this register and discard the result.
        Reading palette data from $3F00-$3FFF works differently. The palette data is placed
        immediately on the data bus, and hence no dummy read is required. Reading the palettes
        still updates the internal buffer though, but the data placed in it is the mirrored nametable
        data that would appear "underneath" the palette. (Checking the PPU memory map should make this clearer.)

        So: reading returns value of buffer, not v. Therefore, if v has changed since it was last read, which it
        probably has, need to read twice, but that's advice to the programmer, not the emulator developer.
        As for 0x3F00 through 0x3FFF, the palette RAM indexes and their mirrors, need to find corresponding nametable?
        There are 4 nametables, duplicated once, so 8. There is one palette RAM index, mirrored 7 times, so 8.
        So to get from the fifth palette RAM mirror, which would be 0x3F80, you'd select the 5th nametable,
        which would be the first mirrored nametable, 0x3000?
        No, just subtract 0x1000. https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=18627:

            "However, I couldn't find any info on exactly which address should be used to populate the read buffer in this scenario.
            From other emulators, it appears to be PPU_ADDR - 0x1000, but I can't really intuit why that is the case."

            "It's the case because the majority of the time (that is, on just about every board but GTROM),
            video memory $3000-$3FFF mirrors $2000-$2FFF. When PA13 is high ($2000-$3FFF), nothing is listening
            to PA12 (the line that distinguishes $0000-$0FFF from $1000-$1FFF and distinguishes $2000-$2FFF from $3000-$3FFF)."
